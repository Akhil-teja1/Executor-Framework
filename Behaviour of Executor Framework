The executor picks up a thread from the threadpool to execute a task. If a thread is not available and new threads cannot be created, 
then the executor stores these tasks in a queue. A task can also be removed from the queue. If the queue is full, 
then the queue will start rejecting the tasks.After the task is completed, the framework will not terminate the executing thread immediately. 
The executor keeps a minimum number of threads in the thread pool even if all of them are not executing some task. 
But it will terminate the extra threads after the specified duration.
